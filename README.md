# calendar-event-api## Getting Started ##Before beginning, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit the settings to reflect your local environment.Install the dependences and generate the autoloader:```composer install```Run the tests:```composer run test```Create the database schema (MySQL-only):```composer run schema```Generate some mock data:```composer run data```Start a local server:```composer run start```At this point, you should be able to use the API with your HTTP client of choice.## Endpoints ##```1. GET /events ‐ get all events- {string} impact, optional query param ‐ allow for specific impact or comparisons (like "1" or ">=1")- {date} from_date, optional query param- {date} to_date, optional query param- {string} instrument, optional query param2. GET /events/{event_id} ‐ get a specific event by ID3. POST /events/{event_id} ‐ edit an individual event```In addition to the above requirements, I added an additional endpoint:```4. POST /events - create a new event```## Notes ##* Please forgive the mock data (I am not familiar with the terminology, or what the data would typically look like, outside of the given data types)* I typically would not write raw SQL with PDO, but I felt like using a combo of Slim + Doctrine wouldn't have left much original code (mostly config)* There are some unit tests for the parser, but none elsewhere due to time/scope constraints.* I used typecasting in a few places as a time-saver only; I would normally never rely on PHP's notoriously unreliable casting mechanics (I favor `filter_var()`, or built-in validation within external libs)* Error responses do not use HTTP error status codes (4xx, 5xx)## Dependencies ##* [Slim Framework](https://www.slimframework.com) for basic routing and request/response handling* [PHP dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) for `.env` file parsing
